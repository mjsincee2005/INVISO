<h1>INTRO</h1>
<h3>The INVISO project is an innovative application of computer vision and image processing techniques using OpenCV. Inspired by the concept of Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak, this project leverages color detection and segmentation to create a real-time visual illusion where any specific colored object appears invisible by replacing it with the background.

By utilizing a single-color detection (such as green, red, or blue), the system detects and masks the target object's color pixels in a video stream, seamlessly overlaying them with the captured background. This effect is achieved by processing frames in the HSV color space, applying bitwise operations, and refining the output with morphological transformations to remove noise and improve accuracy.

This project is a fascinating blend of computer vision, image processing, and real-time video manipulation, making it an engaging learning experience for those interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and OpenCV-based projects. Through the implementation of color thresholding, masking, and background replacement techniques, this project demonstrates the power of OpenCV in real-world applications.
